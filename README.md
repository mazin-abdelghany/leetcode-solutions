# LeetCode solutions
This is a repository of my solutions to practice LeetCode problems in `Python3`. Each solution is in its own file. If my solution differs significantly from the reported solution, then that solution is added to the bottom of the `.py` file and identified as different from my solution via comments in the `.py` file.  

`.py` files with the prefix `z_` are files that I used to try to understand the inner workings of an agorithm or data structure that was applied to a problem. The applicable problem number is in a parenthetical at the end of the file name.
